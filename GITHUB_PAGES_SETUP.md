# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you enable GitHub Pages for the Portfolio Necromancer project to make the landing page publicly accessible.

## ⚠️ Important: demo.py and GitHub Pages

**Can demo.py run on GitHub Pages?** **NO** ❌

- GitHub Pages can **only host static files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- GitHub Pages **cannot run Python scripts** like demo.py
- demo.py is a Python script that requires Python to be installed and executed locally

**Can the OUTPUT of demo.py be deployed to GitHub Pages?** **YES** ✅

- After running `python demo.py` locally, it generates static HTML/CSS files
- These generated portfolio files **can be deployed** to GitHub Pages
- See [Deploying Demo Portfolio Output](#deploying-demo-portfolio-output) section below

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jmenichole/Portfolio-Necromancer
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `main` (or your default branch)
   - **Folder**: Select `/docs`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 1-3 minutes
- You'll see a message: "Your site is live at `https://jmenichole.github.io/Portfolio-Necromancer/`"

### Step 3: Access Your Landing Page

Once deployed, your landing page will be available at:
- **URL**: https://jmenichole.github.io/Portfolio-Necromancer/

## Deploying Demo Portfolio Output

Want to deploy the portfolio generated by `demo.py` to GitHub Pages? Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Generate the Demo Portfolio Locally

```bash
# Run demo.py on your local machine (requires Python)
python demo.py
```

This creates a portfolio in `demo_portfolio/demo/` with `index.html` and other assets.

### Step 2: Copy Demo Output to docs Folder

```bash
# Option A: Replace the current landing page with your demo portfolio
cp -r demo_portfolio/demo/* docs/

# Option B: Create a subdirectory for the demo
mkdir -p docs/demo
cp -r demo_portfolio/demo/* docs/demo/
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push

```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "Add generated demo portfolio to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Access Your Demo Portfolio

- **Option A** (if you replaced landing page): https://jmenichole.github.io/Portfolio-Necromancer/
- **Option B** (if you used subdirectory): https://jmenichole.github.io/Portfolio-Necromancer/demo/

### Important Notes

- You must run `python demo.py` **locally on your computer** first
- GitHub Pages will only serve the static HTML/CSS/JS files you commit
- Each time you regenerate the portfolio with `demo.py`, you need to copy and commit the new files
- Consider using a separate branch or repository for personal portfolios to keep the main repo clean

## Customization

### Update Content
To modify the landing page:

1. Edit `docs/index.html` for content changes
2. Edit `docs/style.css` for styling changes
3. Commit and push to main branch
4. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy

### Custom Domain (Optional)
To use a custom domain (e.g., portfolionecromancer.com):

1. In **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter your domain
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

## Integration Documentation

The `INTEGRATIONS.md` file provides detailed setup instructions for all integrations:

### Available Integrations
1. **Google APIs** (Gmail, Drive, Docs)
   - Email and file scraping
   - OAuth setup guide
   
2. **Slack**
   - Team conversation scraping
   - Bot token setup
   
3. **Figma**
   - Design file access
   - Personal token setup
   
4. **OpenAI**
   - AI categorization and summaries
   - API key configuration
   
5. **Local Screenshots**
   - File system scanning
   - No API needed

All integrations are optional and fully documented.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Pages Not Showing
- **Check**: Settings → Pages shows green "Your site is published" message
- **Wait**: Allow 1-3 minutes for first deployment
- **Verify**: Branch is set to `main` and folder to `/docs`
- **Clear cache**: Try opening in incognito/private window

### 404 Error
- **Check**: Files exist in `docs/` directory on main branch
- **Verify**: `index.html` exists at `docs/index.html`
- **Wait**: Can take a few minutes after pushing changes

### Styling Issues
- **Check**: `style.css` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- **Verify**: Link in HTML: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
- **Clear cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Enable GitHub Pages (follow Step 1 above)
2. ✅ Verify the landing page loads correctly
3. ✅ Share the URL with potential users
4. ✅ Consider adding custom domain
5. ✅ Update content as project evolves

## Support

- **Documentation**: See `docs/README.md` for local development
- **Integrations**: See `INTEGRATIONS.md` for API setup
- **Project Docs**: See main `README.md` for usage
- **Issues**: Open on GitHub for bugs or questions

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can I run demo.py directly on GitHub Pages?

**No.** GitHub Pages is a static hosting service that only serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It cannot execute Python scripts.

### Can I deploy the portfolio generated by demo.py to GitHub Pages?

**Yes!** After running `demo.py` on your local machine, you can copy the generated HTML/CSS files to the `docs/` folder and commit them. See [Deploying Demo Portfolio Output](#deploying-demo-portfolio-output) above.

### Do I need Python installed to view a portfolio on GitHub Pages?

**No.** Once the portfolio is generated and deployed to GitHub Pages, visitors only need a web browser to view it. Python is only needed to **generate** the portfolio, not to view it.

### What's the difference between the landing page and a demo portfolio?

- **Landing Page** (`docs/index.html`): Marketing site for Portfolio Necromancer itself
- **Demo Portfolio**: An example portfolio generated by running `demo.py`, showcasing what the tool can create

### Can I use GitHub Actions to automatically run demo.py?

**Yes!** You could set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run `demo.py` and commit the output automatically. However, this requires configuring secrets and proper permissions. For most users, running `demo.py` locally is simpler.
